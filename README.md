# Dot Does Stuff
The personal website for Chelsea Pritchard.

## About This Site
This site runs entirely on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), using markdown files for the content, rendered by [marked.js](https://marked.js.org/). In order to allow for a wildcard response the main content page is the `404.html` page, as Github doesn't support a wildcard in any other way. The page then reads the URL and requests the coresponding markdown file from the content folder. The search function takes the `writeups.md` file and searches the titles and content in that to parse results. You can view the source for this website [here](https://github.com/DotEfekts/dotdo.es).
